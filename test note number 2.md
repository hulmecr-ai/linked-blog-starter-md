**08/12/25 - reconnect with KE, EH, and Ahikam**
- Insight, Mensch (boaz) 
- Proprietary graph database to see transactions across the systems to see how they should be, like order to cash, procurement, etc and validate the data to make sure you can automate based on 
- Aware of 4 AI ERPs (Campfire, DOSS, Riller, Intuit is also super focused on this) 
- Look at the logos - the chance they replace their ERP is extremely unlikely 
- ERP is glorified DB and workflow infra 
- Order to cash is most sensitive process, relies on CRM, Billing etc. Sometimes ERP sometimes billing engine etc. Procure to Pay (Coupa etc) 
- Long term -  move up to consolidateion layer and reporting (Workiva, Auditboard, Onestream) 
- We can automate the operations (like Concur, Rippling, ZUora, etc), or we can push this into reporting, etc. 
- Example: Check - personal finance management and bill pay. Mint was the competitor but didn't treat the data very well. Used Yodlee instead of Plaid. Just like that, we 
- Intuit buys it for $470M but then realized they need Check's infra so bought it for another ~$400M . Needs a unified set of data and proprietary DB to link across the systems is foundational to run agentic AI on this. When we check the data, we can read documents from the CRM and can constantly validated that we are the source of truth 
- Doordash - custom IBM instance - connects to everything off the shelf and custom tools? Does not replace any tool, just augment what they are doing. 
- Ask for the Doordash customer call
- HC: 18
- PANW coming with the pains they want to solve and just needs a lot of resources 
- 1-2 keys to tackle: Order to cash and order management
- Affirm, MongoDB, Checkpoint - wants TME and expense management 
- Needs to apply structure and expense reimbursement 
- 100's of workflows within order to cash and order management. Many of the processes are similar 
- Problem for the buyers in marketplace - there is no governance around that. Automate the process to integrate into marketplace, identified $8M for WIZ that was forgotten and not billed. Maybe few $M in fees. Can automate different repeating cases 
- Typically 20-30 integrations out of the box today, ie netsuite and salesforce takes like 15 minutes. 
- "Safebooks builder" will make it self serve - the high friction is helpful to learn about the upsell opportunities 
- Klarity - 8 years old doing doc management and OCR - needs to be able to read other unstructured content 
- Nominal - Mathew Cohen wanted to invest in Safebooks. They want to build a another ledger. Its like BlackLine - close management plus intercompany. But we are just automating the data 
- Ken: what signals that they are going to buy now? everyone has these problems for a long time... compelling reason to buy now? 
	- Most of these are inbound: 
		- great talent shortage 
		- wants to reduce direct costs of headcount and outsourcing 
		- know they have data leakage and people are just limited 
- Tekion mentioned Safebooks as their AI platform - they need to do AI in finance. Don't need to replace anything, just reduce the burden of work 
- Replaced team of 35 FTEs that are constantly looking at contracts and order forms. 
- Why now is bc they actually have the product 
- moving from 4A to 4B working with customers like this 
- with CVENT, will be $800K... late stage pipeline is $250K each
- Needs more resources.. needs to scope the stack and then there is friction with onboarding... needs to be handheld... 
	- create initial data scheme, mostly automatically, but then get their feedback, set up the first use case and bring their list
	- Wants to make sure the experience is really great, but ideally their own IT does it 
- has connectors to every system - 4-5 customers onboarding and POCs with 7. A lot of sign off needed to get access to all these systems 
- Raised $7M to date - Propel VC is the lead. 8-10 unicorns. Insight seed fund and a few others 
- $5M at $15M post - another 2 at $25M cap
- Ken: AEs targeting an account - how do they qualify accounts? Just one GTM guy, Steve who is deep in CFO. 
	- have to come with the pain point, already have a very structured and scoped problem
	- mobilize the muscles, ie the 2nd meeting has the whole team - they come educated 
- Zscaler call - feed them with content before engaging 
- Started like 2 weeks ago; still have to focus on this and still doing 1st meetings has a term sheet from the weekend
